              Monde is a package I wrote for emacs. It allows you to interact more easily with your kill-buffer, which is a great addition to my workflow.

              Hava is a cli application, that throws words in a foreign language at you, where you have to make a translated sentence out of those words. It then takes that information to export anki cards. It is still unfinished and I hope to continue working on it someday.

              HattyGame was a game I initially wrote when I learned programming and the C language. Although it is quite basic and not really that profound, I still think it can be fun if you get it running.

            <p class="head">FPGAs</p>
            <p class="content">FPGAs are a really fascinating topic. As is designing your own Computer Architecture. I recently bought a <a href="https://digilent.com/shop/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/">Xilinx based FPGA development board</a> relatively cheaply from Digilent (would recommend). As for what may spark interest in Computer Architecture, I recommend <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444480/Turing_Complete/">Turing Complete</a>, which is a simplified "educationish" game to teach you the basics of Computer Architecture.

            <p class="head">Container Runtimes</p>
            <p class="content">If you have ever interacted with docker, you have probably inadvertently touched some Container Runtime. A Container Runtime is technically everything that isolates some process (unshare) and allocates it resources of the host machine (cgroups). With the excessent use of kubernetes most runtimes need also be OCI complient. This just means it needs to bundle images in a certain way and other not so interesting stuf...
But this is conceptually not that difficult and you can kind of see how containerisation solutions became as popular as they did. If I got your attention, maybe check out <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc">runc</a> or <a href="https://www.ianlewis.org/en/container-runtimes-part-2-anatomy-low-level-contai">this wonderful explanation</a> of Container Runtime details.

          <p class="head">Design</p>
          <p class="content">What does it mean to you? I don't really like that question, but in this case it is intruiging to think about. What does it really mean? Design "designates", quite literally, what sign an object should be conceived with. In case of a tree, meaning the word tree, (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signified_and_signifier">yes, I am refering to de Sassure</a>) I associate it with an abstract version of a tree, maybe a childhood version of the first tree I saw or I liked best, not any tree particular and certainly not yours. Design therefore can't dictate conception, as I can't command you how to sit on your chair. But the designers of the chair had in mind, that a human intelligence would succomb to the idea to sit on it. This, I think, precisely captures the essence of design. But back to Computers. Designing systems or user interfaces accelerates the problem of what design means, because I need to designate a usecase for some "object", which doesn't exist despite the human mind but only within it. Therefore, I need to consider how I can guide you to use the object the intended way by appealing to other abstract concepts. You could say that's how programming languages, api naming convention, function names and guis are supposed to work. We should therefore maybe not talk about design rules or best practices, but maybe keep in mind what we are actually trying to do, guide humans.</p>

            <p class="content">
              Languages, particularly grammar, have always fascinated me since my childhood. Trying to find rules on how to understand structure and meaning in human speech is very interesting. Semantics and syntax, in my opinion, are the gateway drug to mathematics and computer science as you are trying to understand meaning and structure ever more rigorously. I find it is often neglected in education and language teaching, as "it doesn't pertain to anything real or applicable", but I think that misses the point. If all we were doing was applicable, then we would have stopped at hunting. Anyways, language, I think, should be understood very carefully as most of what we humans feel we express with the very same system. If you are in mathematics or computer science and language wasn't really your thing, maybe because of some teacher you didn't like or you didn't like how your language classes were conducted, I suggest try reading more of the humanities part of linguistics (I'd recommend starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Horse,_the_Wheel,_and_Language">The Horse, The Wheel, and Language</a>). If you are in the humanities or social sciences, I'd recommend trying out some rigorous parts of linguistics to get a feeling about how some phenomena can also be expressed very clearly (I'd really recommend any book on formal languages).
